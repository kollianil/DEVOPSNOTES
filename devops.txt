A project resides under master branch, each project has one master branch where all contributors are finally pushed their codes or changes.

Basics commands:
git 
To check version of git
# git --version
To create local repository 
# mkdir demo
# cd demo
# git init
To check status 
# git status 
To link our local repo with central repo
# git remote add origin <link of the central repository>

To pull all files from central repo 
#git pull origin master
To add changes into index
# git add <file name>
To commit changes to git
# git commit - m "comment" <file name>
To push file into central repo 
# git push origin master






Docker :

Microservices --> Is hosted in containers

Containers --> running the apps

Docker -- containerisation tool

Docker is a platform whic can run manage and ship our containers
Docker is a containerisation tool which can create containers kill containers but which cant manage containers(life cycle)

Docker properties :
provides fast delivery of the applications
has high density and runs mopre workloads
aids in quick deployement for easy managemnet


Test to check git changes
